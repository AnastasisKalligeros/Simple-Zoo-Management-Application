# Simple-Zoo-Management-Application

A project that was developed as a university assignment for the subject "Object-Oriented Programming".

The program was written in the Intellij IDEA development environment, in the language Java programming language. The animals are listed on a list that created, which is saved when the program is closed (the data that has been 
loaded/modified will not be lost). The data is not stored in a DB, but saved directly to a file/files according to the requirements of the pronouncement. </br> </br>

<b>Specifically the application will support the following functions:</b> </br> </br>

1. View all available zoo animals. 
2. Add a new animal.
3. Search for an animal by name. 
4. Search for an animal by code. 
5. Edit animal by code. 
6. Deleting an animal by code. 
7. Exit the application. 
For each new animal, the fields stored are as follows: </br>
• Code. </br>
• Animal name. </br>
• Weight (average weight). </br>
• Max Age (average maximum age of the animal). </br> </br>

<b>Ιnstallation Ιnstructions:</b> </br> </br>

1. Download the project.
2. Open the project with Intellij IDEA.
3. Then run it.
4. You will be able to see the main menu.
5. You have the possibility to test all the functions mentioned above. </br> </br>
